Exploring the Orchestra Library with Python
My final project for Spring 2023 Code Louisville, Data Analysis with Python

PROJECT TITLE: 

Exploring the Orchestra Library with Python

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The aim of this project is to work my school orchestra library in Python. 

I am the Strings Director at a Kâ€”12 Independent School. As our school's Strings program is just getting going, I am building a library of music for the student ensembles to play. As I order and gather music, I enter each new piece into a Google sheet (which I downloaded as a .csv file). 

With all the amazing tools of python, including pandas and Matplotlib, I am able to edit and explore the library in a number of ways. 

THE DATA
Each row of data describes one piece of music in the library. Columns have data about the title, composer name, instrumentation, performance history (at the school), and other information. 

PACKAGES NEEDED:
pandas
matplotlib
numPy
matplotlib.pyplot

PROJECT FEATURES
1. Imported data from a .csv file
2. Cleaned and sorted data using pandas
3. Analyzed 5 aspects of the data using pandas
4. Visualized the data in 2 bar charts with Matplotlib
5. Interpreted the data in the Jupiter Notebook file
